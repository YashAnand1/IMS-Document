## **ðŸŽ¯ Overview**

The IMS or Inventory Management System is a centralised system, mainly designed for managing Inventory related details for servers and the applications running on them. It eases the Inventory, Configuration and Runtime Status management process by offering a user-friendly and simple CLI-based interface - that can be used for interacting with the stored inventories.

Some of the key-features of this tool that make its management process easier, are as follows:
- A robust RBAC System for better security & authentication
- Data upload from Inventory-Spreadsheets 
- CRUD Operations on the uploaded Inventory-data

As of now, this document aims to empower Keen & Able Employees with a general and basic understanding of the **Inventory Management System** for managing their Project-Inventories. 

<div align="center">
 
| **Some more features that are to be added include Monitoring, Logs, Versioning, Backup & Restoration. Please note that this document is a work in progress and that it is liable to further changes.** |

## ðŸŒ± **Getting Started** 
<!-- </div> -->

### ðŸŒ¿ **Setting-Up**                                                      
In order **to setup IMS** on a machine, the latest version can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_OnuxlW5WT3tf9PAWjg8bQ2TH9bwPUCc/view?usp=sharing). Once downloaded, follow these steps from the extracted directory: 
- Open the 'etcd-v3.5.10-linux-amd64' sub-directory or install etcd from [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.4/install/#install-pre-built-binaries) if system has a different architecture
- Copy the 'etcd' binary to /usr/local/bin and run the 'etcd' command inside the extracted directory
- In 2 separate terminal tabs, run the 'ims-server' and 'imsclient', by using `./ims-server` and `go run imsclient.go`, respectively.

### ðŸŒ¿ **Creating Inventory-Spreadsheet**                              
Once the etcd-database and IMS-Server are running in the background, the IMS-Client can now be used for managing inventories. However, it is first required for the user to have their Inventory details added in a Spreadsheet that follows [this format](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uD_DGOMjUwTxNnKYPTUNstaMcq13ON43Eb_JR8EJIVc/edit#gid=0). Once the spreadsheet has been created, it should be downloaded in the XLSX format for uploading it to IMS. It is recommended to download in the same directory as the IMS-Client application.

While creating an Inventory-Spreasheet, the following should be ensured:
- No merged cells exist
- Project names & Column-headers do not contain spaces. Ex: `PROJECT 1` should be `PROJECT_1` under the Project column
- Names of column headers are not changed for header-values
- The standardised format is being followed
- Columns for which data is unavailable are being skipped

### ðŸŒ¿ **Creating Custom-Commands**                    
IMS provides the user with the flexibility to create their own custom commands for retrieving inventory-data, by defining column-headers from the Inventory Spreadsheet, for displaying the inventory-data. It is heavily recommended to follow the analogy provided below for creating Custom-Commands related to objects. However, it should be noted that if data is insufficient then user can choose objects according to their preference and data. The analogy is as follows:
```
get ns                                               â€“> Client/Project details - DC, DR
get deployments                                      â€“> Application details
get statefulsets                                     -> Clustered Applications
get replicasets                                      â€“> Load Balanced Applications
get configmap                                        -> Each Application's configuration
get nodes                                            -> Infra details - VMs, BareMetal, Kubernetes Cluster Name
get pods                                             -> Each Application's Instance
get pv                                               -> Total Storage (SAN/LAN)
get pvc                                              -> Individual Application's Shared Storage (Block Device, File)
get svc                                              -> Application Endpoints (Ports)
get ingress                                          -> Load Balancers & Ingress (In case of K8S-based application)
```

| Example: `get nodes` could be used to tabularly display Inventory-data with columns like RAM, CPU, WWWN, etc. |
|----------|

Now when the user would run 'get <custom command>', the columns defined under that mentioned command will be displayed in the IMS-Client application.

In order to create custom-commands, the user is required to open the `ims.conf` file from the extracted directory. An explanation of what the content of the `ims.conf` includes is as follows:
```
http://127.0.0.1:3000                                                                -> IP of Machine Running the IMS-Server
                                                                                     -> Mandatory Gap
3                                                                                    -> Number of commands
NAMESPACE                                                                            -> Command Name
PROJECT=project_name                                                                 -> Project Name (Same as Project Column)
HOSTNAME,IP,APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT,DATA_CENTER,SETUP_ENVIRONMENT                    -> Included Columns
DEPLOYMENTS                                                                          -> Command Name
PROJECT=project_name                                                                 -> Project Name (Same as Project Column)
HOSTNAME,IP,APP_NAME,OWNER_CONCTACT_DETAIL,APP_DESCRIPTION,GIT_ENVIRONMENT           -> Included Columns
NODES                                                                                -> Command Name
PROJECT=project_name                                                                 -> Project Name (Same as Project Column)
RAM,MEMFREE,MEMUSED,SWAPFREE,SWAPTOTAL,TYPE,OS,OS_VERSION,KERNEL_VERSION,DATA_CENTER -> Included Columns
```

In the above file, the IP address is of the machine running the IMS-Server. Since we are running IMS-Server on the same machine as the IMS-Client, we use the loop-back address. While creating the custom-commands, the following should therefore be ensured:
- IP Address should be loop-back if Server application is running on the same machine as the Client application
- The mandatory gap after IP Address should not be cleared 
- The sequence of the Command Names, Project Names and Included Columns should not change
- Any spaces (" ") should be avoided
- Mentioned Project Names and Included Columns should match the Inventory-Spreadsheet

### ðŸŒ¿ **Managing Inventories With IMS-Client**                               
Once the Inventory-Spreadsheet and Custom-Commands have been made, the `ims-client` executable should be run for getting started with managing inventories. Provided below are explanations of the steps required to use IMS-Client for Managing Inventories.

**1. Logging In**          
After the `ims-client` applicaton has started, the user would be required to login. This can be done by entering User as `admin` with Password `admin`. These credentials are permanently created when this application has been run for the first time. 

<div align="center">
  
![img](https://i.imgur.com/bUR5108.png)
</div>

**2. Uploading Inventory**                
Use `upload <spreadsheetname.xlsx>` when the Inventory-Spreadsheet is present in the extracted directory or `upload </path/to/spreadsheet/spreadsheetname.xlsx>` if the Spreadsheet is in another directory.

<div align="center">
  
![img](https://i.imgur.com/wXMCgpy.png)
</div>

**3. Retrieving Data: Using Custom-Commands**       
Once the spreadsheet has been uploaded, user can start interacting with the uploaded Inventory-Data using the Custom-Commands from the `ims.conf` file. As an example, the output of running the `get <custom-command>` or `get namespace` would be as follows:

<div align="center">

![img](https://i.imgur.com/H8dxFg0.png)
</div>

**4. Retrieving Data: Using Listing**                
Since it is also possible that a user may wish to retrieve information from a specific data, they can use `list <column name>`. For example if a user wishes to list all of the hostnames, they can use `list hostnames`:

<div align="center">

![img](https://i.imgur.com/TWktVhM.png)
</div>

**5. Retrieving Data: Using Filtering**          
Filtering of the data can be done from the IMS-Client Application using the `select <column1>,<column 'n'> FROM <project> WHERE <column="value">`. Through this way, users can create SQL-like filters on the uploaded Inventory-data and fetch specific information as per their preference. An example of such filtration is:
```
select HOSTNAME,IP,APP_NAME,RAM FROM XYZ WHERE RAM="64GB",OS="RHEL"
```
<div align="center">

![img](https://i.imgur.com/apVKMgH.png)
</div>

Similarly, filtering of the data can also be done directly from the `ims.conf` file. An example of such filtration would include modifying the `ims.conf` in the following manner:
```
NAMESPACE
PROJECT=XYZ|RAM=64GB|OS=RHEL
HOSTNAME,IP,APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT,DATA_CENTER,SETUP_ENVIRONMENT
```
Here, a filter is set for the PROJECT XYZ where only those servers are to be displayed that have 64GB RAM and RHEL as their OS. Such multiple filtering can come in handy when retrieving very specific information. If filter is to be removed, the `|RAM=64GB|OS=RHEL` condition will be deleted and from the IMS-Client, user will have to run `reload conf` to load update changes.

</div>

**6. Updating Data**              

Users can update an existing cell by updating it using commands like `UPDATE --KEY /<NameOfClientFromSpreadsheet/RowNumber/ColumnHeader NewValue`. In this example, the first argument after the `--KEY` flag is the key of that cell and the argument afterwards is its value. Use case: If a user wishes to update the 'Setup Environment' of a server for a client called `CLIENTNAME` from 'Staging' to 'Production', they can do so by running `update --key /CLIENTNAME/1/SETUP_ENVIRONMENT Production`:

<div align="center">

</div>

**7. Creating Rows**            

Users can also create a new row using commands like `CREATE  --KEY /<Client_Name>/<RowNumber>/PROJECT <Project_Name>`. Use case: If a user wishes to add a new row called to the existing inventory, they can do so through the following steps: 
- `select project`
- `create --key /CLIENTNAME/3/PROJECT XYZ` where XYZ is the name of the project for which a third row is to be added

<div align="center">

![img](https://i.imgur.com/hHMuOti.gif)
</div>


**7.1. Adding Data To New Rows**
In IMS, the cells are represented by key-value pairs. When a user creates a new row, it's values will be empty and any cell which has <nil> as its value, would mean that its key has not been created for storing this cell's value. **NOTE:** In the current version of IMS, the user would still need to create keys-value pairs for the newly created row even if <nil> is not being displayed and values from columns above are being displayed instead.

To add the values to the cells, I ran the following commands that were in the form of `CREATE --KEY /<Client_Name>/<RowNumberOfCell>/<HeaderOfCell> <Cell_Value>` for creating keys for representing the cells:
- create --key /CLIENTNAME/3/HOSTNAME Machine3
- create --key /CLIENTNAME/3/IP 10.249.221.23
- create --key /CLIENTNAME/3/APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT APPLICATION
- create --key /CLIENTNAME/3/DATA_CENTER dc-Kolkata
- create --key /CLIENTNAME/3/SETUP_ENVIRONMENT Dev

The output of following the steps above for creating key-value pairs are as follows:

<div align="center">

![img](https://i.imgur.com/0sIpAwI.gif)
</div>

**8. Creating Columns**   
The new column can be created by running the `CREATE --KEY /<Client_Name>/<RowNumberOfCell>/<NewColumn> <Cell_Value>`. This new column has to be included under the custom command in the `ims.conf` file for which the output is to be retrieved. After the modification has been made, `reload conf` is to be run inside the IMS-Client Application. 

An example of creating a column is `create --key /CLIENTNAME/2/NewColumn ValueForRow2`, which will create a column called 'NewColumn' with its second row valued with 'ValueForRow2'. Similarly, the value of the first row of this column can also be added by running `create --key /CLIENTNAME/1/NewColumn ValueForRow1`, where the 'ValueForRow1' value is entered in the first row of the 'NewColumn' column.

<div align="center">

</div>

**9. Deleting Cell**              

Users can delete an existing cell using commands like `DELETE  --KEY /<NameOfClientFromSpreadsheet/RowNumber/ColumnHeader Value`. Use case: If a user wishes to remoe the hostname for a server, they can do so by running `delete --key /CLIENTNAME/3/HOSTNAME Machine3`:

<div align="center">

</div>

### ðŸŽŠ **User Access & Control**                
IMS utilises Role Based Access Control for security purposes to decide what actions are permitted to which user. By default, `admin user` is created with complete access over IMS but users added afterwards, will be low-level users with limited access. The steps of utilising RBAC are as follows:

1. **Create Users** using the following command:      
```
CREATE --USR <USERNAME>
```

2. **Delete Users** using the following command:      
```
DELETE --USR <USERNAME>
```

3. Command to **Switch Users** while staying in the IMS-Client application:
```
LOGIN
```

4. Command to **Change User Password** of the current user using the following command:
```
PASSWD
```

5. **Listing Users** using the following command:
```
LIST USR
```

## ðŸ’¢ Troubleshooting Issues & Errors:
