## **ðŸŽ¯ Overview**

The IMS or Inventory Management System is a centralised system, mainly designed for managing Inventory related details for servers and the applications running on them. It eases the Inventory, Configuration and Runtime Status management process by offering a user-friendly and simple CLI-based interface - that can be used for interacting with the stored inventories.

Some of the key-features of this tool that make its management process easier, are as follows:
- A robust RBAC System for better security & authentication
- Data upload from Inventory-Spreadsheets 
- CRUD Operations on the uploaded Inventory-data
